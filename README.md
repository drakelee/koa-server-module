## Purpose
A core Koa server module to be used as a dependency in a Node service. Provides middleware options as well as logging
capability backed by Winston.

## Usage
In your index.js or entry point in the application, import the Server class and instantiate it, passing in the Koa routers 
for all the routes in the app. 

## WIP
* Make middleware configurable
